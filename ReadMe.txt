Linux System Monitoring Tool
============================

Project Overview
----------------
After completing a comprehensive Bash scripting course, I developed my first project – a Linux System Monitoring Tool.

This tool is built entirely with Bash scripting and is designed to help users monitor and manage their Linux systems efficiently. It provides real-time insights and alerts about system performance, making it easier to track and maintain system health.

Key Features
------------
- Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Provides alerts with INFO, WARNING, and CRITICAL levels
- Displays colored output for better readability in the terminal
- Lists the top 5 CPU-consuming processes
- Tracks system uptime
- Reports currently logged-in users
- Logs monitoring data to a file for historical reference
- Offers a menu-based interface for easy interaction
- Supports optional automation via cron jobs for scheduled checks

Project Purpose
---------------
The goal of this project was to create a **practical, real-world tool** that demonstrates Linux system monitoring using Bash scripting. It applies automation techniques and provides a **user-friendly interface**, turning routine monitoring tasks into an organized, automated workflow.

Outcome
-------
This project shows hands-on experience in Bash scripting, system monitoring, and workflow automation. It serves as a useful tool for system administrators and Linux users to maintain performance, detect issues early, and simplify daily system management tasks.
